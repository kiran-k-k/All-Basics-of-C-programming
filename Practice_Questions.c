/*âœ… 30 Unique & Creative C Programming Practice Questions (Basic to Intermediate)

ðŸŸ© Basics & Logic Building

1. Write a program to take a character input and print whether it is a vowel, consonant, digit, or special symbol.
2. Write a program to toggle the case of each character in a string (e.g., "HeLLo" â†’ "hEllO").
3. Accept two 3-digit numbers and check if they have the same digits in any order (e.g., 123 and 321).
4. Write a program to count how many digits a number has without using loops (use log10()).
5. Write a program to simulate a basic login system (username and password match using strcmp()).

ðŸŸ§ Control Structures & Conditions

6. Write a program to check whether the sum of any two digits of a 3-digit number equals the third digit.
7. Write a program to print all Armstrong numbers between 100 and 999.
8. Take a number and check if it's a Harshad number (i.e., divisible by the sum of its digits).
9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 100, but:
    If divisible by 3 â†’ print "Fizz"
    If divisible by 5 â†’ print "Buzz"
    If divisible by both â†’ print "FizzBuzz"
10. Write a program to reverse a number and check if it's a palindrome in the same loop.

ðŸŸ¨ Loops and Patterns (Creative)

11. Print a pattern where each row contains alternating 0 and 1, starting with 1.
12. Create a pattern like a checkerboard using  and space for n Ã— n grid.
13. Print a diamond pattern using numbers from 1 to n.
14. Generate a pattern where each row contains only prime numbers in increasing order.
15. Print a spiral number matrix of size n Ã— n.

ðŸŸ¦ Arrays & Logic Building

16. Accept an array and move all zeros to the end while maintaining the order of other elements.
17. Accept an array and remove all negative numbers from it.
18. Accept two sorted arrays and merge them into a single sorted array.
19. Rotate a square matrix (nÃ—n) by 90 degrees clockwise.
20. Write a program to find the second largest element in an array without sorting.

ðŸŸª Strings & Manipulation

21. Accept a sentence and capitalize the first letter of each word.
22. Accept a string and count repeated characters and print them (e.g., "programming" â†’ r, g, m).
23. Accept two strings and check if one is a rotation of the other (e.g., "abcde" and "deabc").
24. Write a program to remove all duplicate characters from a string.
25. Accept a string and print its most frequent character.

ðŸŸ¥ Structures & Problem Solving

26. Define a structure to hold cricket player info and find the player with the highest strike rate.
27. Create a structure for books and find the book with the most pages.
28. Store student records (name, marks in 3 subjects) and find the student with the highest total marks.
29. Design a program using structure to store and calculate time (hours, minutes, seconds) and add two times.
30. Create a simple structure-based voting system to count votes for 3 candidates and declare the winner.
