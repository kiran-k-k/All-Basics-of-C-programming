/*This is a basic C program that asks the user multiple-choice questions, takes input as answers 
(A/B/C/D), checks correctness, and displays the final score. It uses arrays, strings, loops, 
and conditionals to manage questions and evaluate answers. This project helps beginners practice 
logical thinking and C fundamentals.*/
